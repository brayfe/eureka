# Every migration must have a source plugin, which controls the delivery of our
# source data. In this case, our source plugin has the name "beer_term", which
# Drupal resolves to the PHP class defined in
# src/Plugin/migrate/source/BeerTerm.php.

  # Here's another new plugin - migration. When importing data from another
  # system, typically the unique identifiers for items on the destination side
  # are not the same as the identifiers were on the source side. For example, in
  # our style data the term names are the unique identifiers for each term,
  # while in Drupal each term is assigned a unique integer term ID (tid). When
  # any such items are referenced in Drupal, the reference needs to be
  # translated from the old ID ('ale') to the new ID (1). The migration
  # framework keeps track of the relationships between source and destination
  # IDs in map tables, and the migration plugin is the means of performing a
  # lookup in those map tables during processing.

    # 'style_parent' is the parent reference field from the source data. The
    # result of this plugin is that the destination 'parent' field is populated
    # with the Drupal term ID of the referenced style (or NULL if style_parent
    # was empty).
