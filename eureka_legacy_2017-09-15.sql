	(1,2704,'Richard','Richardson',NULL,'Our research interests relate to ecological restoration and conservation, particularly of prairies.  We explore how functions of the soil ecosystem are critical for establishing and maintaining a healthy plant community. In particular for prairies, recycling organic matter from above ground plant growth to below ground communities is greatly facilitated by herbivory, particular by large ungulates. Initially the herbivores were bison or elk, and today primarily they are livestock. \r\nTo achieve the beneficial effects, herbivory must be controlled to avoid overgrazing, and to optimize the burial of vertebrate dung by insects, such as dung beetles. In addition, ungulates (bison, cattle, sheep, etc.)herd closely together for protection and their hoof impact is important for preparing seed germination and seedling survival of many species of grass. This \"cultivating\" behavior therefore is facilitated by pack-hunting predators in open range land. However, skilled human herders can easily simulate the appropriate behavior and achieve the important patterns of disturbance needed for healthy prairies. \r\nWhen properly managed to achieve appropriate grazing patterns and have the needed physical effects on the soil surface, the livestock are useful for revegetating areas with little plant cover. If animals are supplied with hay and the area is seeded with appropriate mixtures of grass and forbs, even mining wastes can become productive. For examples, there are links from the class web site for Natural Resource Management. (www.utexas.edu/courses/resource) \r\nFrom this above ground activity the diversity of soil organisms (bacteria, fungi, insects, nematodes, earthworms, etc.) transform \"dirt\" into soil!\r\nIn our most recent work, we are making digital videos of \"soil critters\" through a dissecting microscope.

Molecular approaches are used to characterize proteins that are critically involved in mediating the coupling of light and gravity stimuli to morphogenic changes in plants. Studies of light-induced signal transduction leads to a focus on potential signaling proteins that function primarily or partially in the nucleus. Nuclear proteins recently characterized include an annexin, an apyrase (= NTPase), a CK II protein kinase, lamins, a nucleolin, protein phosphatases and Ran (a monomeric GTP-binding protein). For most of these proteins, their cDNAs have been characterized and the effects of light on the abundance of mRNAs that encode them have been documented. Several of them include the study of the phenotypes of transgenic Arabidopsis plants that ectopically express the sense or antisense versions of their genes. Antibodies to most of these proteins have been raised to help immunolocalize them and quantitate their expression. Most of the proteins carry out their nuclear functions in partnership with other proteins. To help define these binding partners the yeast two-hybrid system is being employed. Investigations of the molecular biology of these proteins should help to clarify how they function in plant photomorphogenesis.\r\nRecently found is that the apyrase enzyme, which is primarily nuclear in etiolated plants, is localized primarily in the the plasma membrane in light-grown plants, with its active site facing out into the extracellular matrix. It thus qualifies as an ectoapyrase. Since ATP is the preferred substrate of this enzyme, its ECM localization raises the question of the function of extracellular ATP (xATP). It has been found that xATP occurs in soil environments and that the pea ectoapyrase, which is strongly expressed in roots, can not only hydrolyze phosphates from xATP, but also promote the uptake of the released phosphate. Surprisingly, it can also promote the uptake of inorganic phosphate and can complement a yeast mutant deficient in a high-affinity phosphate transporter. It has also been found that the Arabidopsis multi-drug resistance transporter, MDR1, can promote the transport of ATP out of yeast and plant cells, just as its homolog in vertebrates has been reported to do in animal cells. It has been found that the hydolysis of xATP by ectoapyrase and other ectophosphatases, which increases the steepness of the ATP gradient between the inside and outside of cells, increases the efficiency of toxin export across the MDR1 transporter both in transgenic yeast and in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.\r\nFor gravitational studies, a single-cell model system has been developed, germinating spores of Ceratopteris richardii, in which gravity orients the direction of nuclear migration and subsequent rhizoid development and growth. The utility of this system for defining the genes needed for gravity responsiveness is being investigated. A Shuttle experiment (STS-93, July 1999) has been completed which allows the identification of genes that are differentially expressed in microgravity and to examine the role of these genes in mediating the gravity response.','http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/roux/',1,'2010-02-03 13:43:43',NULL),

His current book-in-progress,  Human Nature as Cultural Design: The Political Challenge of Genetic Enhancement, explores core issues in bioethics. Rapid advances in genetic engineering, particularly of human embryos and fetuses, pose difficult social, political, moral, and legal questions that challenge a range of different conceptions of a just society.\n.\nCAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS 2012, paperback 2013\n.\nTitle: Human Rights as Social Construction\n.\nMost conceptions of human rights rely on metaphysical or theological assumptions that construe them as possible only as something imposed from outside existing communities. Most people, in other words, presume that human rights come from nature, God, or the United Nations. This book argues that reliance on such putative sources actually undermines human rights. This book envisions an alternative; it sees human rights as locally developed, freely embraced, and indigenously valid. Human rights can be created by the average, ordinary people to whom they are addressed, and that they are valid only if embraced by those to whom they would apply. To view human rights in this manner is to increase the chances and opportunities that more people across the globe will come to embrace them.\n.\nUNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA PRESS (2016)\n. \nTitle: The Human Rights State\n.\nThe global institution of nation state sovereignty impedes the advance of human rights. By reconfiguring the politics of national boundaries into a politics of boundaries metaphorically “embedded” within the individual, I propose an alternative: the “human rights state,” which is guided by an inclusionary logic in distinction to the exclusionary logic of the sovereignty-fixated nation state. In this way the individual would endogenize some of the critical features of political and legal “bordering.” He or she would “carry” this border around with him- or herself as a status function assigned by the human rights state. Citizenship would then refer to the moral and juridical incorporation of the individual within a nongeographic sphere of human rights. Nongeographic borders embedded in the citizen would operate inside the contemporary nation state and directly challenge it. The human rights state, by displacing the legitimacy of human rights from the geographic state, moves legitimacy to a cross-national or transnational level. A central feature of this approach: cross-national or transnational legitimacy refers not to some sort of  organization but rather to the human body as such. Political legitimacy —— in the sense of human rights whose legitimacy would no longer be tied to whatever nation state might embrace them —— needs to be both local and universal. It needs to be local because even with the advent of the human rights state, the practice and protection of human rights will be the more effective to the extent that it can be a primarily local matter. At the same time, moral and legal legitimacy might be grounded on the identity of all humans in terms of the body, with the same frailties and needs and vulnerabilities, equally in need of protection. The human rights state offers a means for legal rights and legal justice to attain global status. \n. \nWork-in-progress, accepted for review at CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS\n.\nTitle: Human Nature as Cultural Design: The Political Challenge of Human Genetic Engineering\n.\nFor the first time since evolving 200,000 years ago, Homo sapiens sapiens may soon transform itself biologically, a development no less significant than Copernicus’ transformation of the geocentric world view or Darwin’s of the anthropocentric understanding of animal life. One aspect of transformation is irresistibly hopeful: making predictive genetics available to all persons so that all might avoid or minimize genetic risks; providing prenatal genetic modification to decrease disease-susceptibility, eradicate congenital disabilities and extend life-span. But a different aspect of transformation unnerves: like the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, it forces us to re-evaluate our understandings of ourselves as human beings and our relationship to other forms of life on our planet. I do just that in a book I am currently writing titled Human Nature as Cultural Design: The Political Challenge of Human Genetic Engineering. For reasons I develop below, I argue that we humans should regard our own nature as socially constructed rather than as something given naturally or supernaturally.\n\nConsider, for example, the prospect of genetically engineering human intelligence. And of the many questions that pose themselves, consider two.\n\nFirst, is it ethical? The answer to this question depends on the ethics one invokes in answering it. Any answer is likely to involve one or the other of the many conceptions of human nature.\n\nIf “human nature” is something natural, such as an aspect of a wholly naturalistic understanding of the evolved species homo sapiens, then engineering any part of it, including human intelligence, is not unethical from the standpoint of natural science because natural science has no moral content, indeed no meaning whatsoever.\n\nBut over the last ten thousand years, this worldly nature has been interpreted non-scientifically again and again, for example from the otherworldly perspectives of religion and metaphysics. These perspectives invest nature with distinctly non-natural properties. The Book of Genesis, written in the 6th or 5th century BCE, invests the natural universe with divine design and purpose. From that perspective, engineering the human being may be regarded as violating a sacred design (but presumably only for those who share this very particular worldview).\n\nModern biology has no concept of what philosophers, theologians, and poets call “human nature.” Still, modern secular political communities, such as liberal democratic nation states, need to socially construct a range of human natures for purposes of social organization. Above all, one or the other notion of human nature can be useful in grounding the normative legitimation of a system of laws and to guide some forms of public policy.\n\nFor example, the German Constitution, Article 1, declares that “human dignity shall be inviolable.” The term dignity may be interpreted as allowing the engineering of human intelligence; it can just as well be interpreted as not allowing it. Either interpretation will base itself on a particular conception of human nature. That conception will be law not because it is true — propositions about nature can be true or false (as a matter of objectivity) whereas propositions about how people should be treated can be just or unjust (as a matter of intersubjective social construction).\n\nIn sum, whether it is ethical to engineer human intelligence depends on what ethical system one deploys to answer this question. There are many ethical systems in history, in the world today, and new ones no doubt will be developed in the future. All of these are incompatible with each other to various degrees, and agreement on any one is in principle possible, but exceedingly unlikely today. The basis of such agreement would be a political act of a global embrace of a particular cultural understanding, for example like the widespread conviction today that slavery is unacceptable on any grounds.\n\nA second question about prospect of genetically engineering human intelligence concerns desirability. Again, any answer to this question depends on one’s particular point of view (there are no “objective” or “neutral” standpoints here). From whom might it be desirable or undesirable? For the individual? For his or her community? For humankind? For the planet? In each case, both yes and no are plausible answers. For intelligence in any environment is double-edged: it has no inherent moral compass and can facilitate just behavior as well as unjust, decency no less than barbarism.\n\nConsider the individual: greater intelligence means heightened capacity to imagine and realize goals — but could just as well damn the recipient to the continual frustration of a world that will not bend to his or her will. Consider the community: heightened intelligence promises a more productive, creative, and thoughtful populace — but could also result in more aggressive, selfish persons better able than unenhanced citizens to take advantage of fellow citizens. Consider humankind: might a species of greater intelligence better find its way to a peaceful world of just communities — or to an intellectual, social, and material “arms race” among competing groups? Consider the planet: would a species of higher intelligence be a better steward of the fragile planet it shares with other species — or one more rapacious, because its heightened intelligence unleashed heightened needs and the will to realize them even at the planet’s expense?\n\nThis exercise merely shows the obvious: that the knife that can save a life can also take a life. Less obvious because necessarily hypothetical are unintended consequences. The very fact of their not being intended marks such consequences as risks. Some risks follow simply from the powerful, exceeding complex interdependencies of various variables. While some risks pay off, others don’t. Is heightened intelligence worth that risk? We cannot yet know.\n\nFurther, engineering costs money and, at least initially, only wealthy persons would be able to afford the enhancement. In this way, engineered intelligence would exacerbate existing social and economic disparities if, as seems likely, greater intelligence confers advantages in the various spheres of life in which people compete for advantage — spheres in which some are perpetual losers.\n\nIn short, whether it is ethical and desirable to engineer higher intelligence depends not on the heightened intelligence as such but on the complex weave of social, political, economic, cultural and ecological factors that compose human communities. These factors constitute the environment in which bearers of engineered higher intelligence behave. Consider just two factors: wealth and influence. Money is power and people struggle mightily against each other to gain more wealth and wield greater influence, both as individuals and as groups and as nation states. If, as seems likely, heightened intelligence confers advantages, at least to some recipients, at least some of the time, at least in some circumstances, one can imagine a socially destabilizing struggle to control access to it—a struggle with winners, losers, and “collateral damage.” But not necessarily.\n\nAny estimation of the problems and prospects of human intelligence, whether engineered or not, will depend on some conception of human nature. If human nature is a social construction, the two questions I consider above will find quite a range of answers in a context of deep, intractable, and abiding disagreement within communities and across cultures. But I would hope to persuade my readers that the idea of humankind directing, politically, the course of its own evolution need not mean taking control of the species’ genome. It could mean taking control of the socially constructed cultural environment in which genetic enhancement takes places. The moral and political question — is there some kind of human nature and, if so, what it might be? — is then the question of what constitutes human well-being, just social arrangements, as well as individual and collective virtue. It is, in short, the question: not, What *is* our nature? But rather: What do we *want*, what *should* we want, our nature to be?','http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/government/faculty/bggregg',1,'2011-06-10 18:14:42','2016-08-02 12:09:58'),

This information is needed to understand nitrogen biogeochemistry and to quantify the relative importance of internal nitrogen regeneration processes compared to inputs from other sources in these highly productive ecosystems.

	(308,3014,'Richard','Meyer',NULL,'Replication and conjugal transfer of broad host-range plasmids.\nAlthough most plasmids in Gram-negative bacteria have a restricted host-range, a few groups are widely distributed among unrelated species. These plasmids are disseminated primarily by conjugation, a process that can result in the transfer of plasmids not only between bacterial species, but also into eucaryotic cells. In our laboratory, we are focussing on how plasmid DNA is processed for conjugal transfer. This problem has practical medical significance, since broad host-range plasmids generally encode resistance to one or more antibiotics, and are probably contributing to the increasing frequency of multiple drug-resistance in bacteria by providing a mechanism for interspecific gene transfer and maintenance. \nWe have been investigating the conjugal transfer of the broad host-range plasmid R1162. Our objectives are to map the genes involved and to characterize their regulation, and also to identify the gene products and the sites at which they act. Ultimately, we wish to describe in detail the molecular steps in transfer, and to identify those properties which free the plasmid from the constraints imposed by different cytoplasms. We have identified the R1162 genes required for transfer, and have mapped oriT, the origin of transfer, to a 38 base-pair segment of the plasmid. We are in the process of determining how the R1162-encoded proteins interact at oriT to carry out the DNA processing steps required for the initiation and termination of transfer. To this end, several specific questions now are being investigated in our laboratory: \nDuring conjugation, a single, linear DNA strand is transferred. This strand is generated by nicking at oriT, and occurs within the relaxosome, a complex of oriT DNA and several plasmid proteins. How does this nicking occur, and what determines its strand- and site-specificity? \nThe nicked strand is transferred with 5\' to 3\' polarity. Is there rolling circle replication of the plasmid DNA during conjugation, so that the transferred strand is replaced in the donor cell by synthesis primed at the 3\' end? \nOnly one strand is transferred during conjugation, but R1162 consists of duplex DNA. How is the complementary strand synthesized in the recipient cell after transfer? \nIn the relaxosome, nicking and religation of oriT DNA are probably occurring continuously. What directs the nicked strand into the conjugation pathway? \nR1162 is not self-transmissible, but depends on other plasmids for many of the functions required for conjugation. However, different plasmids are parasitized with distinct and characteristic efficiencies. How does R1162 communicate with its mobilizing vector during conjugation, and what determines the efficiency of transfer?','http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/directory/details.aspx?id=1700',1,'2008-05-08 16:41:39','2013-12-10 12:56:57'),
	(309,3015,'Ian','Molineux',NULL,'The main interests of this laboratory are in understanding the interactions of bacteria and their parasites, both plasmids and bacteriophages. Three major lines of research are being followed, all using bacteriophages as model parasites, and E. coli as host. \nHow hydrophilic nucleic acids pass through a hydrophobic lipid bilayer, as during phage or viral infection, or as eukaryotic RNA transport through the nuclear membrane is not understood. They are using infection by phage T7 as a model to study DNA translocation across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Cellular internalization of the complete T7 genome is a slow process, taking 10 minutes under normal conditions of infection, and they have developed an assay that monitors the rate and extent of genome entry. Current projects include identification of the E. coli and phage proteins that are involved in the passage of phage DNA from the phage head into the bacterial cytoplasm and to determine the source of energy for the process. They can also stop translocation of the phage DNA at a defined position on the genome during its entry into the cell, and intend to characterize the membrane channel through which the DNA is passing. \nT7 grows well on most strains of bacteria to which it can adsorb; however, if the host cell contains the F plasmid, phage development is suddenly aborted midway through the infection. This abortive infection is a model for a common, but unexplained, biological phenomenon where the presence of one parasite in a cell protects from invasion by a second, unrelated parasite. The T7 - F interaction has become a more experimentally tractable model system than most other abortive infections. They have shown that expression of either of two separate phage genes, gene 1.2 and gene 10, and the single F gene pifA are responsible for the abortive infection. Ongoing projects in the laboratory include determination of the biochemical and physiological functions of these genes in the abortive infection. Plasmids expressing either gene 1.2 or gene 10 are normally lethal to cells expressing pifA; induction of a repressed phage gene in the presence of PifA leads to immediate and complete inhibition of all macromolecular synthesis and active transport in the cell. No other phage gene causes, or is necessary for, these physiological defects, which are identical to the defects seen during an abortive phage infection. The lab has selected for host mutants that tolerate the presence of each phage protein together with F PifA and are presently identifying the mutant E. coli genes by classical and molecular genetic techniques. One of these genes has not been defined previously and likely codes for an integral membrane protein. Some other mutants afford unprecedented levels of resistance to the antibiotic tetracycline and may thus be altered in novel E. coli functions. \nBacteriophage f1 and its close relative M13 are parasites that do not kill their host: progeny phage are continually extruded through the cell membrane. Phage production does, however, slow the growth rate of the bacterium. By selecting for faster growing phage-infected cells, they have discovered that the phage can integrate into the bacterial chromosome and exist as a stable lysogen or pseudolysogen. This result was totally unexpected, since f1 only contains 10 genes, none of which are known to function like the phage l repressor. The chromosomal and phage attachment sites by DNA sequencing are being identified and a genetic analysis of both the phage and host genes that are required for stable integration are beginning.','http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/directory/details.aspx?id=1707',1,'2010-02-03 11:59:09','2013-12-10 16:36:40'),

As many species have complex mating rituals, successful mating requires both the perception of appropriate stimuli and ultimately a decision on how to respond. How the stimuli are perceived and responded to can differ between females of the same species. Such individual variation in female preference has profound evolutionary consequences (e.g. speciation by sexual selection). Hence, it is important to uncover the proximate mechanisms that determine how a female chooses a mate, particularly the modulatory and regulatory interplay between behavior, neural circuitry, and genes. Since, behaviors, neural and gene networks do not operate independent of each other, my research collectively will allow me to begin to understand and devise a model of the interactions between behavior, brain and genes in mate choice.','https://webspace.utexas.edu/ryw57/Main.htm',1,'2009-09-10 05:49:46',NULL),

Several components of these systems have been implicated as tumor suppressors in mammalian organisms, thus establishing DNA repair factors as major targets in the progression from normal to unregulated cell growth. Current studies in the lab involve the biochemical activities of a complex of proteins, Mrell/Rad50/Nbs1 (M/R/N), which are critical components in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Much of the ongoing research involves the regulatory interactions between the M/R/N complex and other proteins known to be involved in the homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining pathways. These also include regulatory kinases such as ATM, ATR and DNA-dependent protein kinase, as well as the products of the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Paull\'s primary goal is to achieve an understanding of the mechanistic roles of these factors and how they cooperate to guard the cell against genetic rearrangement. In addition to DNA repair, the M/R/N complex is essential for telomere maintenance and for the initiation of meiotic recombination, both processes which involve specialized double-strand breaks. Currently, the model of M/R/N action within the cell is one in which the activities of the complex have varied outcomes depending on the context of the double-strand break and the molecular partners available for regulation.','http://w3.biosci.utexas.edu/paull-lab/',1,'2010-02-03 12:45:47','2014-01-17 09:16:33'),

We also pattern samples with a variety of lithographies, ranging from optical (one micron), to electron beam (50 nm), and down to STM (9 nm so far). All this supports a wide variety of projects:\n\nSurface studies of cleaved YBa2Cu3O7-x -\nWe discovered that the CuO chains in this compound have a charge modulation [PRL 69, 2967 (1992); PRL 73, 1154 (1994); PRL 75, 1387 (1995)] that was not predicted by theorists. Our observations have been confirmed other groups using neutron scattering and NMR. We are now adding a magnetic field to search for superconducting vortices.\n\nColossal Magnetoresistance (CMR)-\nWe make thin films of CMR materials, such as LaxCa1-xMnO3, by co-evaporation of the pure elements in a low pressure of oxygen. We have studied the magnetic and electronic properties of these films. We were the first to obtain images of magnetic domains in these materials, by using our homemade low temperature Magnetic Force Microscope [Science 276, 2006 (June 27, 1997)].\n\nNanostructures-\nWe developed a new technique for making metal lines as narrow as 9 nm by using an STM to break down organometallic gases.[APL 51, 247 (1987)] That was the \"easy\" part. We have also managed a much more difficult experiment: to connect these tiny wires to external leads for measurements of resistance vs. temperature. So far the smallest wire measured in a \"four-point probe\" configuration is 60 nm wide. Such small wires show quantum effects at temperatures below 50K. This project is also relevant to the fabrication of nanoscale electronic devices. We are now synthesizing carbon nanotubes an using them as STM tips for this project.\n\nMesoscopic waveguides and cavities in 2DEGs-\nThis is a new project in collaboration with Prof. Linda Reichl\'s theory group. We will be starting with a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) grown in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure by Prof. Ben Streetman\'s group. We will use our electron-beam lithography setup to pattern metal electrodes with the shape of waveguides and cavities, all in the order of 100 nm in size. We will then cool the samples in our dilution refrigerator down to 25mK and we will measure the conductance of these structures in magnetic fields up to 8 Tesla.

Their importance derives from their ubiquitous presence in MOS devices, and from the sensitivity of device performance and nonlinear optical properties to interfacial properties such as microroughness, strain, contamination. Their simplicity derives from the small number of tensor components required to describe the interfacial nonlinear optical response. Yet the exceptionally weak interfacial susceptibility c(2)s has strongly inhibited quantitative interface second harmonic spectroscopy of Si(001) interfaces in the past. With state-of-the-art unamplified Ti: sapphire femtosecond lasers, we overcome this barrier by enabling dramatically higher SHG efficiency than with previous laser sources with minimal interface heating.2\r\nDr. Downer\'s Femtosecond Spectroscopy Group has developed two applications of interface nonlinear optics with femtosecond lasers as a real-time, noncontact diagnostic of Column IV semiconductor interfaces during processing and growth: a) ex situ SHG to measure angstrom-scale microroughness, metal contamination, and strain at the technologically important Si(001)/SiO2 interface, and directly in MOS device structures. 3,4,5 b) in situ SHG to monitor epitaxial growth rate, precursor adsorption and desorption kinetics during CVD growth of silicon and silicon-germanium films;2,6 There are two over-arching goals to this work: 1) to understand the nonlinear spectroscopy of semiconductors interfaces at the most fundamental level, e.g. to understand physically how and why the SH spectum of silicon is sensitive to hydrogen coverage, doping, strain, microroughness, applied electric fields and other technologically important parameters. Recent observation of fourth harmonic generation at GaAs surfaces7 using a femtosecond source is an exciting breakthrough in fundamental surface nonlinear optics. 2) To develop practical SHG-based interface monitoring instruments and procedures useful to the microelectronics industry.

Transformation of lymphoid cells by the v-rel oncogene. \r\nEfforts are directed toward defining the mechanism by which lymphoid cells are transformed by the v-rel oncogene.  v-rel is the transforming member of the Rel/NF-kB family of transcription factors.  The major function of the Rel/NF-kB family is to coordinate the expression of genes involved in natural immunity such as cytokines, adhesion molecules, acute phase response proteins, and other mediators of inflammation.  This family of transcription factors also plays an active role in acquired immunity (T cell activation, immunoglobulin synthesis) and the control of apoptosis.  v-Rel is a truncated version of the c-Rel proto-oncoprotein and has lost transactivation  sequences and a cytoplasmic retention domain providing it nuclear access.  v-Rel also contains numerous point mutations which also contribute to its oncogenicity.  v-Rel homodimers are the principal Rel/NF-kB complexes present in the nucleus of transformed cells.  Also present in the nucleus are complexes containing v-Rel heterodimerized with other members of the Rel/NF-kB family. We are defining which v-Rel dimers are responsible for transformation of T cells, B cells, monocytes, and fibroblasts.  We are also identifying genes which are differentially expressed in v-Rel transformed cells by differential display.  We have direct evidence that c-fos and c-jun are major players in the v-Rel transformation pathway.  v-Rel also upregulates a gene which encodes an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) which is critical for maintaining the transformed phenotype and contributes to the oncogenicity of v-Rel.  We are defining the mechanism by which IAP is transcriptionally regulated and how deregulation of IAP contributes to the oncogenic process. \r\nThere is a mutant of v-Rel which principally transforms B cells.  A single point mutation in the DNA binding domain alters its DNA-binding specificity and is responsible for its B-cell tropism.  We are using this B-cell tropic mutant of v-Rel to identify genes which are involved in B-cell lymphomagenesis. \r\nRel/NF-kB family members are also involved in the induction of apoptosis.  We are in the process of identifying which Rel/NF-kB heterodimers are involved in the apoptopic pathway, and identifying genes which exhibit altered transcription patterns during apoptosis.  Recently, we have identified a novel gene which inhibits apoptosis in murine B-lymphocytes.  The gene encodes a 80kDa protein which is localized in the Golgi.  This gene is expressed at highest level in germ cells in the testis and we are evaluating whether it may be involved in regulating germ cell numbers in the vertebrate testis.','http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/MGM/people/faculty/profiles/bose.htm',0,'2010-01-29 14:01:49','2014-09-30 14:51:13'),

Such deserts are characterized by having thick grass tussocks and scattered trees with periodic fires that clear the landscape and replenish the soils. Different lizard species react to these fires in different ways. Some species have populations where individuals are incredibly abundant in the absence of fire, but then they all either die or emigrate away during or after a fire. Oppositely, individuals of some species thrive in the wake of a fire and are rarely seen in times between fires. These two sets of lizards constitute the extremists as far as reactions to fires. Many other lizards do not exhibit huge population fluctuations in response to fire, but are able to adapt to changing conditions. My current research focuses on HOW lizards are able to adapt immediately to a dramatically changing environment including a huge shift in available food resource. Adaptive foraging behaviors could possible be the best explanation for why individuals of some species can ride out the waves and others crash into extinction. To test this idea our lab has a large collection of lizards that were collected from a field site in Australia where samples were taken before and after a prescribed burn. From these specimens we analyze stomach contents to see what they were eating before the fire and what they were eating after. A significant change in diet composition would indicate that members of a species are able to survive a fire by adapting to new food sources.

We focus on gene expression at the level of transcription, regulated by transcription factors and chromatin structure (epigenetics), but are also interested in post-transcriptional regulation mediated by non-coding RNAs.

The program graduated 22 Ph.D. students and produced 95 refereed publications. Dr. Laude is best known for his research with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR). His students conducted research on fundamentals of ion motion in trapped ion cells, development of novel FTICR instrumentation and applications in analytical biochemistry. The laboratory developed a unique approach to coupling electrospray ionization with FTICR detection - the use of concentric, differential pumped vacuum chambers. The lab also worked on ion remeasurement techniques in which the same packet of ions is stabilized and remeasured hundreds of times. The group investigated the viability of open trapped ion cells for FTICR. These cells were found to possess a unique and potentially important stability region for trapping ions and permitted the first demonstration of three-dimensional ion stability in a d.c. trapping field. This approach to motional stabilization is radically different and far simpler than other methods now in use in FTICR and suggest a potentially new approach to ion trap mass spectrometry. Finally, efforts to understand the higher-order structure of gas phase biomolecules was performed using electrospray/FTICR. Techniques including H/D exchange, ion dissociation and ion mobility were used to distinguish the effects of charge and structure on gas-phase conformation.\n\nhttp://cns.utexas.edu/student/cns_staff/laudecv.pdf','http://www.cm.utexas.edu/david_laude',1,'2010-02-05 14:55:48','2011-09-08 16:20:40'),

To answer this question, the Zhu Lab uses model interfaces for organic and quantum dot solar cells and state-of-the-art laser spectroscopic techniques, including femtosecond time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy (2PPE) and time-resoved second harmonic generation (SHG). As examples, recent discoveries in the lab showed for the first time how an electron and a hole is bound by the Coulomb potential across an organic semiconductor interface and how one can extract hot electrons from a photoexcited PdSe quantum dot.\nCharge transport and organic electronics\nCharge carrier generation and transport are central to the operation of all organic electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), field effect transistors (OFETs), and photovoltaic cells (OPVs). A fundamental distinction from their inorganic counter parts is the localized nature of charge carriers in organic semiconductors. Dr. Zhu and his collaborators apply in situ optical spectroscopy to directly “see” inside operating devices. This spectroscopic approach allows them to quantitatively establish the nature of charge carriers in organic and polymeric semiconductors. Recent highlights include quantitatively distinguishing electrostatic from electrochemical doping mechanisms and understanding the Mott insulator-to-metal transition in gate-doped polythiophene.\nChemical control of bio-interfaces\nInterfacing man-made materials to biological systems is a common challenge to a number of important fields, including biomaterials, biosensors, microarrays, and nanomedicine. The lab is designing surface chemistry to rationally control such interfaces and probing these soft interfaces using physical tools, such as interfacial force microscopy. Recent highlights include the development of surface chemistry which optimizes the activity of immobilized proteins and allows the “digital” switching of this activity. Another design has led to the successful fabrication of a fluidic and air-stable supported lipid bilayer; this can be the basis for cell mimicking microarrays in high throughput studies, e.g., the screening of nanomedicine targeting cell surface receptors.','http://www.cm.utexas.edu/xiaoyang_zhu',0,'2010-02-08 12:32:14','2013-11-08 16:33:45'),

	(954,3660,'James','Walker',NULL,'Cell division in bacteria.  \nOne of our research interests is the mechanism of DNA replication in the bacterium Escherichia coli and the relation of replication to the cell division cycle. Most of the replication proteins and the genes which encode them have been identified through the work of many labs. The important problems now are to determine how the individual proteins function in controlling initiation at the replication origin, in polymerization of daughter strands at replication forks, or in terminating and segregating chromosomes. One gene of particular interest, dnaX, encodes two proteins, both of which are components of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, the enzyme complex which catalyzes polymerization of daughter strands. \nDNA polymerase III holoenzyme consists of a core (a e q subunits) plus obligatory auxiliary factors b, t, g, d, d\',c and y. It has been proposed that this enzyme functions in vivo as an asymmetric dimer to coordinate leading and lagging strand synthesis. Functions of some individual subunits have been studied in vitro. t d or g d transfers b to primed templates; (a e then bind and polymerize. b acts as a sliding clamp to tether ae to the template. \nBoth t and g are products of one gene, dnaX. The 71 kDa t is the full-length translational product of the 643 codon dnaX messenger RNA. The shorter g is formed from within the same reading frame when the ribosomes encounter a programmed ribosomal frameshift signal over codons 428-430. About half of the ribosomes change the reading frame by shifting back one nucleotide. After incorporating one amino acid in the new frame, a stop codon is encountered and translation ends. Thus, g is identical to the first 430 amino acids of t but ends after codon 431 which incorporates a unique residue. The frameshift signal is so strong that 50% of the ribosomes shift and the ratio of t:g produced is 1:1. Purified t is a single-strand DNA-dependent ATPase and dATPase. Although g is not an ATPase (dATPase), it binds ATP and the g d complex is an ATPase. It is not clear how these ATPase activities fit into holoenzyme functions. \nSpecific questions under study include the function of ATPase (dATPase) activities of t and g d in polymerization. Localized mutagenesis has altered the dnaX gene (on a plasmid vector) in the region which encodes the ATP binding regions of t and g. Purified mutant t and g will be tested to determine their defectiveness in supporting synthesis in vitro and the function of ATP hydrolysis in assembling the b clamp. A second question concerns the requirement for each t and g in vivo. Are both required or can one protein substitute for the other? Knowledge of the mechanism of forming t and g allowed the construction of a mutant dnaX allele which synthesized only t (i.e., which had eliminated the frameshift signal without altering the amino acid sequence) and another allele which synthesized only g (by deleting the 3\' end of dnaX). These mutant alleles have been crossed into the chromosome, replacing the wild-type dnaX gene. These studies prove that t is essential but that g is dispensable. Therefore, t can perform all the functions of g in b clamp loading plus it has some unique, essential activity. We propose that its unique function is dimerization of holoenzyme, because t is known to dimerize core in vitro, and that the dimerization is essential to coordinate leading and lagging strand replication in vivo in cellular organisms. Mutants which lack t are unable to grow because of the failure to coordinate leading and lagging strand synthesis. \nThe significance of g and its role(s) in vivo are being studied by the two approaches. First, mutant alleles which synthesize only t and which are mutated in selected domains are being constructed and crossed into the chromosome; the ability of alleles which encode only g to support growth of those strains will be tested to determine what activities g has in vivo. Second, conservation of the t:g pair and the programmed frameshift signal during evolution are being studied as a test of g significance. Among four genera of Enterbacteriaceae tested, all had t:g homologs and DNA sequencing has shown that the closely related Salmonella typhimurium has perfectly conserved the programmed frameshift signal. This degree of conservation suggests that g has some useful function. \n A third question involves expression of the dnaX gene. This gene is located among a group of genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism.  These include apt (an adenine salvage enzyme), recR (plasmid recombination), htpG (heat shock) and adk (adenylate kinase). Preliminary evidence shows that, although the genes have separate promoters, some of the apt transcripts extend into adk.. Additional studies will investigate the mechanisms which control expression of these genes. \nA second major research interest is the control of expression of the tRNA gene, argU. This gene encodes an arginine tRNA which recognizes AGA codons. Both the tRNA and cognate codon are among the rarest tRNAs and codons [the cellular concentrations of tRNAs is correlated with frequency of cognate codon usage]. argU expression is severely inhibited by a dyad symmetry region from -3 to +25 (+1 is the transcription start point) which, because of recent finding of a protein which binds this region, probably acts as an operator. Both the operator and the putative repressor protein are under study. A second question is the relevance of tRNA concentration and codon usage frequency to controlling macromolecular synthesis and growth.\n \nDNA polymerization.   \nGene expression regulation.   \nInitiation of replication','http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/walker/',1,'2008-05-08 16:41:41','2015-03-24 15:22:45'),

One of the applied areas of their research is the development of rapid immunological assays for detecting insect contamination in a wide variety of foodstuffs. The amount of insect contamination present in a food sample provides an indication not just of the amount of contamination present at the time of testing, but also gives an estimate of the quality of sanitation to which the material has been subjected during past storage and handling. Insect analysis also serves as a guide to the amount of insect infestation likely to be encountered in further storage and transport. Federal statutes regulate the amount of insect contamination that can be present in a broad range of foods, ranging from grains such as wheat, oats, and barley to spices, nuts, dried fruits, and macaroni. For these reasons it is important to have available test procedures which can reliably and quantitatively estimate the degree of insect contamination of these materials. The Kitto Lab\'s  aim is to develop assay procedures that combine an excellent degree of accuracy and repeatability with a high degree of sensitivity. The plan is to devise tests that can be used with minimal training and which would be of low cost. Another area of applied research in which they are engaged is the development of immunotoxins for AIDS therapy. In this case, the Group is taking advantage of the fact that when the AIDS virus infects cells, some of the components of the virus are incorporated into the cell membrane of the infected cell. These virus proteins can serve as a target for immunotoxins. The immunotoxins with which the Group is working with utilize potent plant toxins linked to monoclonal antibodies directed against the virus proteins. The rationale behind this approach is that when the immunotoxin specifically attaches to virus-infected cells and is imported into the cell. There the toxin inactivates protein synthesis, causing cell death. Basic research efforts are concerned with understanding the evolution of the oxygen binding properties of hemoglobin. Dr. Kitto and his collaborators are engaged in structural and functional characterizations of the multiple hemoglobins of the sea cucumber Caudina arenicola and comparing the properties of these invertebrate pigments with those of their vertebrate counterparts.

The difficulty in studying these non-ideal heterogeneous materials is that they contain a wide variety of environments. Bulk spectroscopic methods average together multitudes of these different environments, thereby masking the source of particular features and complicating the interpretation of experimental results. Two recent experimental developments have made direct probing of heterogeneous systems possible: near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) and single molecule spectroscopy (SMS). NSOM studies are devoted to investigating the electronic and optical properties of organic thin film materials. In these materials, it is critical to understand the role of various charge and energy carriers in the system. However, vapor-deposited and spin cast thin films have widely varied morphologies that strongly affect their properties. The group\'s research is eliminating these problems by directly probing thin films with NSOM. A wide array of techniques can be used for imaging including transmission, fluorescence, polarization, and time-resolved spectroscopies. The Vanden Bout Group is currently studying a number of materials including polyfluorene, sexi-thiophene, poly thiophene and others.The second half of the work deals with dynamics near the glass transition in small molecule liquids and polymers.

In both of these areas, the main questions concern the flow of energy: where does it go, and how long does it take to get there. Dr. Wyatt\'s research involves both methods of development and the application of new methods to problems of current experimental interest. \nReaction dynamics \nIn the area of reaction dynamics, his research is primarily concerned with the development and application of new methodologies in quantum scattering theory. During the past few years, variational approaches have been emphasized in which one sets up a functional involving the so far unknown scattering wavefunction. Optimization of the functional yields equations for the \"best\" scattering wavefunction. This approach has been applied to several chemical reactions, including H + D2 and F + H2. The resulting cross sections and product state distributions have been in encouraging agreement with recent experimental data. More recent theoretical developments have allowed the inclusion of the so-called geometric phase in the variational formulation. These powerful methods use matrix linear algebra and are thus highly suited for applications executed on supercomputers. \nIntramolecular dynamics \nIn the area of intramolecular dynamics, a powerful algorithm for computing time-dependent transition probabilities has been developed. Instead of attempting to diagonalize very large matrices, the useful information is extracted using a matrix recursion algorithm. The resulting algorithm, termed the RRGM, has permitted the largest calculations yet performed on high energy spectra and molecular energy flow. Particular emphasis has been placed upon analysis of the energy transfer pathways in the laser excited benzene molecule. In addition to these large recursive calculations, new codes have recently been developed to study the high energy vibrational dynamics in acetylene, which can isomerize to the short-lived intermediate vinylidede. When completed, these calculations will be very useful in the interpretation of experimental data obtained with the stimulated emission pumping technique. Other calculations related to the origin of mode selective dissociation in small molecules are planned.','http://www.cm.utexas.edu/robert_wyatt',0,'2010-02-08 12:10:12','2013-10-25 11:21:54'),

Understanding these pathways is an important goal of modern pharmaceutical research.  The MAP kinases, which are important mediators of cellular signals, are believed to play major roles in tumor formation and progression to metastasis.  They are also striking enzymes that regulate cellular processes with remarkable efficiency and specificity.  Despite intense research, in no case do we fully understand how they work. For example, we don’t have a very clear understanding of how their cellular activity is regulated, or what factors determine their cellular substrate specificity.   \nOne focus in our laboratory is to understand the biochemical basis for the regulation and mechanism of the MAP kinases.  We are using state-of-the-art enzyme kinetic techniques, in conjunction with structural methods, to address these questions.  Another goal of our work is to develop small molecule and peptide inhibitors of MAPK pathways that can be used to elucidate their role in cancer progression.  More recently, we have begun to develop new chemical-biology tools, which we hope will be used to interrogate MAPK pathways in more detail than is presently possible.  With currently available methods it is not possible to quantify the activity of MAPKs at specific locations in cells, or to instantly switch them on or off and ask what they are doing at a specific point in time.

Eastman\'s broadest goal is to show that gender is a fundamental organizing theme in these highly popular and much-reprinted volumes, and that by analyzing them together with the social histories of printing, engraving, and reading, we can view ideas about gender as an Atlantic phenomenon, extending beyond the unique gender behaviors of specific cultures or geographic regions.

This disease is caused by mutations in a very large gene and result in the loss of a large protein known as Lyst. The size and low abundance of this protein have impaired the detailed analysis of its function and how its absence leads to the dysfunction of lysosomes in CHS patients. A simple model system has been established to study the molecular function of Lyst and closely related proteins in the organism Dictyostelium discoideum. It has been shown that the loss of a similar protein in this organism results in the same lysosomal defect.  Currently the wide array of molecular tools available in this model system is being studied to dissect the function of Lyst-related proteins. The hope is to use this as a starting point to better understand the human disease and design potential therapies. Also of interest is understanding how eukaryotic cells accomplish the last stage of the cell cycle: cytokinesis. Several proteins important for cytokinesis have been established and have generated knockout mutants lacking these proteins. The phenotypes of these mutants are then analyzed using a variety of cell biological techniques including imaging of GFP-labeled proteins. One of these proteins called LvsA plays a role in membrane traffic, while another called INCENP binds to chromosomes and microtubules. The analysis of proteins like these will help delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in cell division.','http://www.zo.utexas.edu/faculty/delozanne/adlab.html',1,'2010-01-29 14:54:47','2014-11-14 09:30:16'),

Examining the evolutionary physiology of Manduca sexta.  This moth lives across the US in both desert and non-desert areas.  He is interested in how it copes with hot, dry desert conditions.  Is it by acclimation, in which each individual fine-tunes its physiology to local conditions?  Or have desert populations evolved specialized means of coping with hot, dry conditions?  How does acclimation affect evolution?\r\n2. Interactions between temperature and oxygen.  Most invertebrates are poikilotherms, meaning that their body temperatures track environmental temperatures.  Woods\' projects start with the observation that fluctuating temperatures profoundly affect metabolism but usually has only modest effects on oxygen transport.  As a consequence, the balance between oxygen supply and demand shifts with temperature--in particular, hot poikilotherms should be relatively oxygen starved. Experiments in this area have used both insect eggs and marine-invertebrate egg masses.\r\n3. The biophysics and ecophysiology of gas exchange across insect eggshells. Insect eggs usually are abandoned by their mothers after laying. Embryos have everything they need inside the eggs, except oxygen.  To obtain sufficient oxygen, their eggshells must allow oxygen to cross from the environment to the embryo.  But this creates a problem--because structures that are permeable to oxygen also are permeable to water.  So having a very permeable eggshell may allow lots of oxygen in, but at the risk of letting too much water out.  How do insect eggs solve this problem?  To answer this question, Woods is studying the structure, biophysics, physiology, and evolution of eggshells.','',0,'2010-02-17 12:48:18','2014-02-14 09:38:47'),

HIs research can be broadly subdivided into three areas: (1) molecular evolution, (2) evolution of RNA viruses, (3) theoretical population genetics.\n1. One of the major open questions in molecular evolution is to identify the dominant constraints that shape protein evolution. The commonly held view is that most constraints are caused by protein function. However, recent evidence indicates that selection for adequate protein expression and folding may play a more important role in shaping evolutionary rates than selection for protein function. Wilke is studying how point mutations and recombination affect protein folding, how a protein\'s structure affects its evolutionary rate, and more generally is working towards a theory of protein evolution firmly grounded in protein biochemistry.\n2. RNA viruses (such as influenza virus or human immunodeficiency virus) tend to have high mutation rates, and evolve rapidly in reaction to immune response or treatment. Frequently, they adapt to new hosts, and the majority of newly emerging infectious diseases are RNA viruses that cross the species barrier from animal host to human (examples are SARS or the avian influenza). However, a high mutation rate also implies frequent deleterious mutations. Wilke is studying questions such as how RNA viruses can thrive under high rates of deleterious mutations, how they can mask the effect of deleterious mutations under coinfection, and how they adapt to changing hosts.\n3. The origins of theoretical population genetics date back to the early 20th century, and today the basic theory of population genetics is well understood. Nevertheless, many open questions remain. Wilke is working mainly on the speed of adaptation in asexual populations, on neutral evolution, and on population dynamics in time-dependent environments.','http://cssb.utexas.edu/members/claus-wilke/',1,'2010-02-05 13:19:27','2015-03-25 11:12:23'),

Sometimes even the smallest sensory cues can drastically alter how we react to our environment. The underlying neural networks must thus be able to differentiate between small variations in the input. At the same time neural networks have the ability to rapidly adapt to changes in the environment.\nThe problem we face when we try to study the mammalian brain is given by the high interconnectivity between neurons. A functionally closed system thus consists of hundreds of thousands of neurons. At the same time nonlinear processes in the smallest subcellular compartments can have a decisive impact on the output of the whole network. We thus face the challenge of having to observe a large number of neurons, and at the same time their small parts of neurons.\nThe focus of this lab is thus to use existing tools and develop new ones in order to achieve this goal. One of the methods used is two-photon imaging in combination with electrophysiology. This method allows us to image opaque tissue like the mammalian brain. Recently we were able to record from the individual synapses between pairs of neurons.\nUsing these methods we will examine the contribution of nonlinear dendritic processes to network information processing and to the information transformation within a cascade of networks.','http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/directory/details.aspx?id=1923',0,'2010-02-01 13:26:31','2014-09-30 15:27:43'),

Dr. Sung and his collaborators are particularly interested in the epigenetic regulation of the floral transition by environmental cues, such as temperature and photoperiod.  The prolonged cold of winter, known as vernalization, is one such cue that certain plants use to acquire competence to flower the following spring.  In Arabidopsis, vernalization results in the mitotically stable repression of the potent floral repressor, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC).  The molecular nature of this environmentally-induced epigenetic change has been a fascinating question in plant biology.  They have shown that the series of Histone modifications are involved in the epigenetic repression of  FLC by vernalization.  Furthermore, the diversity of Histone modifications that are related with vernalization-mediated epigenetic changes suggests that FLC chromatin could be used for the model system to study Histone biology in plants.  Those at the Sung Lab would like to use this environmentally-induced epigenetic switch as a model system to study chromatin remodeling in eukaryotes.','http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/sung/',1,'2010-02-05 12:07:59','2014-02-05 09:44:33'),

Gromov:\nDoes every one-ended word-hyperbolic group contain a closed, hyperbolic surface group?\nThe answer to this question is known for Coxeter groups (Gordon-Long-Reid ’04), graphs of free groups with non-trivial rational homologies (Calegari ’08), 3-manifold groups with positive virtual betti numbers or more generally, hyperbolic 3-mainfold groups (Kahn-Markovic ’09). However, the general approach is still widely open. What Kim and Henry Wilton have recently discovered is that there is a simple combinatorial property for a word in a free group that provides a sufficient condition for a double of a free group amalgamated along that word contains a surface group. This serves a model case for general one-ended word-hyperbolic groups according to the JSJ-theory of Sela and Bowditch.','http://kim.sh/main/kim.sh.html',0,'2010-02-12 14:29:03','2013-12-05 09:12:20'),

Recently they have also developed a quantitative non-Markovian theory (milestoning) that extracts information from short-time dynamics and allows the calculation of longtime biologically relevant processes. Their ideas, theories, and algorithms are summarized in the software package MOIL. On the bioinformatics front they develop machine-learning approaches to model protein structures from sequences (summarized in our web server LOOPP).

With some 10 11 tons produced and destroyed each year, we need more information on its structure and its biosynthesis. My research has taken me on many venues and to many places on the Planet. Cellulose is composed of a seemingly simple linear polymer chain of glucose molecules; however, its biosynthesis is extremely complex. For instance, two distinct polymerization reactions involving a cellobiose intermediate lead to the formation of the B-glucan polymer chain. Then, a multiple enzyme complex known as the \"terminal complex\" \"threads\" these chains together to produce a crystalline nanostructure known as a \"microfibril\". Our research with cellulose involves light and electron microscopy as well as biochemistry and molecular genetics. The integration of these approaches has led to a much better understanding of this all important global polymer system. We think of trees and cotton as the major plants that produce cellulose; however, cellulose is made by some animals (tunicates) which presumably received their cellulose synthase genes from lateral gene transfer. Cellulose is also synthesized by prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria. Among these is the gram negative rod, Acetobacter xylinum which can spin its cadre of cellulose nanostructures from pores arranged linearly along the bacterial surface. The resulting cellulose extruded into the medium forms the world\'s most dense and extensive biofilm. In fact, microbial cellulose has the potential for introducing new and exciting physical forms of cellulose which have proven to be superior for a number of products. That is why I am also researching microbial cellulose in such products as: (a) electronic paper; (b) burn and wound care as well as a host of new medical products; (c) scaffolds for new tissues and body parts; (d) drug delivery; (e) audio speaker parts; (f) components of batteries and supercapacitors; and (g) components to improve music instruments such as classical guitars, violins, piano sounding boards, reeds, drums, etc.\n\nI was trained and received my doctorate in the area of  phycology which is the study of algae. I have used these fantastic organisms to study the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus as well as the great genetic diversity of cellulose biosynthesis. I have also been one of the major investigators of the ecological distribution of algae in the atmosphere where I have studied \"airborne algae\". Earlier, with John P. McGovern, we discovered that many airborne algae cause human inhalant allergies! Much more work needs to be done in this area and I am open for undergraduate involvement in all of the above as well.\n\nI was one of the first researchers to investigate the DNA viruses of algae. Recently, I have renewed my interest in the photosynthetic prokaryotic algae known as \"cyanobacteria\" or more commonly as \"blue green algae\". These are the oldest oxygen evolving microbes on earth having been here some 2 billion years, and the cyanobacteria also produce cellulose! Through mining of genomes, we found that the cellulose synthase genes of land plants and most eukaryotic algae came from the cyanobacteria through a lateral gene transfer event.\n\nWe are now focusing many of our research efforts on using cyanobacteria grown in raceway ponds to produce and secrete sucrose or simple sugar. The sugar will be used as a feedstock to microbes such as yeasts and bacteria that produce products such as ethanol, butanol, and hydrocarbons which can substitute for gasoline and other biofuels. Cyanobacteria offer a great promise to become one of the critical \"spokes in the wheel\" of approaches in sustainable energy. Our work with cyanobacteria involves collection of new strains, culture and physiological adaptation to various media, growth in specialized fermentors, including scaleup to outdoor ponds at the Brackenridge Field Lab, and ultimately to prototype scaleups in Texas for the massive production of feedstocks as well as biomass for numerous applications. \n\nI invite you to visit our lab to learn more about what we are doing.

Although apparently different processes, class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation, and gene conversion may share common mechanisms. One salient feature is that these processes are closely linked with transcription. The precise role of transcription is unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed. One potential function of transcription is to open up chromatin structure and render the recombination targets accessible to recombination factors. Secondly, transcription is capable of inducing unusual DNA structures, which have been implicated in recombination. Thirdly, transcription could recruit recombination factors to the target sites.

	(2398,5104,'Marvin','Whiteley',NULL,'Bacteria exhibit many social activities and represent a model for dissecting social behavior at the genetic level (recently defined as sociomicrobiology). One example of social behavior in bacteria is the use of small molecules to communicate within a bacterial population, a process referred to as quorum sensing. Recent work has provided evidence that quorum sensing allows bacteria to amass a coordinated response in a density-dependent manner to accomplish tasks which would be difficult to achieve for a single bacterium. Although much is understood about the molecules used for communication, little is known about how these molecules are trafficked within a bacterial population or how these molecules are perceived by individual bacterial cells. My laboratory is interested in understanding the mechanism of signal trafficking between bacterial cells and how these signals are perceived by individual cells. We currently use two pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and a plant commensal Sinorhizobium meliloti to study signal trafficking and perception between bacterial cells and between bacteria and eukaryotic cells. Recent evidence in our laboratory indicates that some bacteria package signals into membrane vesicles that facilitate delivery of these molecules to other cells within the population. This mechanism of signal trafficking is significantly impacted by the nutritional environment and studies are currently under way to understand how specific nutritional cues impact the ability of bacterial cells to produce and perceive signals. The overall goal of my lab is to understand signal trafficking and perception at the molecular level as well as provide an ecological role for these communication systems in the natural environment.','http://www.icmb.utexas.edu/directory/details.asp?id=2858',1,'2010-02-05 13:12:59',NULL),

The primary experimental approaches used in the laboratory are macromolecular structure determination and allied biophysical techniques.

The appropriate assembly of the transcription apparatus is governed by information programmed in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. This so-called \'CTD code\' operates through changes in the conformation of CTD, which are affected largely through alteration of the phosphorylation state of this domain. Her main research interests focus on how phosphorylation of CTD is regulated and how this phosphorylation affects the outcome of transcription, and in turn, how these processes are involved in important biological phenomena such as cancer and neurogenesis. Ultimately, the aim is to exploit the results from this research in the design of small molecule effectors that can intervene in the CTD processes and thereby function as regulators of gene expression.','https://icmb.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/67-icmb/154-zhang-yan?Itemid=1243',1,'2010-02-08 12:18:49','2015-05-07 12:36:26'),

Otolith chemistry has the potential to reveal key information about identity and movement patterns that is essential for the effective management of exploited species and ecosystems.  Dr. Walther is particularly keen to combine otolith chemistry methods with alternative approaches to assess movement and connectivity, including genetics, tissue stable isotopes, and satellite telemetry.  He strongly believes the combination of these diverse methods can potentially triangulate questions that would be difficult to answer using only one approach.\nA second major area of interest is the degree to which environmental events such as can be detected in chemical signatures of both otoliths and other biogenic carbonates (e.g. corals, bivalve shells).  For instance, Ba/Ca ratios are most abundant in nutrient-rich waters and they can serve as powerful proxies for temporal fluctuations in upwelling or sediment plumes in reef or estuarine habitats.  Analyses of these proxies in carbonate skeletal hard parts allow us to reconstruct time series of environmental variability for specific habitats.

The work is based on growing evidence that adult neurogenesis constitutes a functionally and, perhaps, clinically significant form of brain plasticity. Neurons are added to the adult hippocampal formation of all mammalian species studied to date, and the cells that are born appear to impact both cognitive and emotional aspects of hippocampal function. Manipulations that suppress adult neurogenesis impair performance in some hippocampus-dependent learning tasks, and adult neurogenesis is bi-directionally regulated by stimuli that affect the risk for emotional disorders. For instance, psychosocial stress potently suppresses hippocampal neurogenesis, while exercise, environmental enrichment, and virtually all antidepressant treatments stimulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis. My approach to understanding the functional significance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis relies on inducible genetic manipulations in mice, combined with rigorous behavioral analysis, and addresses questions such as (1) what underlying psychological processes depend on adult-generated neurons, (2) how do decreases or increases in adult neurogenesis affect these processes, (3) and what special properties of adult-generated neurons are instrumental in producing these effects?','http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/directory/details.aspx?id=4277',1,'2010-10-01 16:12:10','2013-09-27 08:30:17'),

And how should the resulting change in the system be detected and evaluated? Hippocampal neurons are organized into three broad classes: excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory. In some cases, the classes can be subdivided further, on the basis of neurochemical markers, mainly calcium binding proteins and neuropeptides. We work in mice, using these differences in the complement of expressed proteins to target specific cell populations. As an alternative, we are developing novel genetic approaches designed to identify and access neurons displaying heightened activity during memory tasks. Selected neurons are sensitized to subsequent manipulation using a variety of heterologous receptors and ion channels. We then evaluate the effects of cell-type specific optical or pharmacological perturbations on hippocampal circuit dynamics (electrophysiologically) and on animals’ memory functions (using behavioral assays).\n','http://clm.utexas.edu/faculty/dr-boris-zemelman/',1,'2010-10-01 16:26:44','2014-09-12 15:10:23'),

Diana is not the central character, but she stands out from the rest; as she ages, she grows in strength and self-possession and, at the end of the novel, she is granted her wish to live with the woman she desires in the house that she loves. In order to reach that happy ending, however, Diana has to sublimate her desire for her sister-in-law into gardening. This may not have frustrated Diana but it frustrated me. Why go to the trouble of writing her as a desiring character, just to deny her any sex? I felt that there was a connection between this contradictory character (rebellious, subservient, masculine, passive, desiring, asexual) and Keane\'s satire on and apparent nostalgia for the final days of the Irish Ascendancy. My impulse was grounded in a belief that our national and sexual identities are deeply and intimately intertwined, but it was also rooted in a twenty-first century perspective on sexual desire and the importance of sexual satisfaction. While I have retained the former notion, I have had to question the latter, or at least complicate it. As I went looking for positive representations of women’s sexual desire (homosexual or heterosexual) in women’s Inter-war novels in both England and Ireland what I repeatedly found instead was a resistance to the idea that sexual satisfaction was necessary for women’s happiness.','http://instructors.cwrl.utexas.edu/bacon/node/1237',0,'2012-03-01 12:47:47','2013-09-13 10:44:51'),

Current classes of drugs for these indications include corticosteroids, muscarinic antagonists, beta2 agonists, and leukotriene inhibitors.  While these drugs have proven effective in marketed inhaled products, poor control over inhaled dose, unwanted side effects, and development of drug resistance remain a major limitation of inhaled therapies.  In pediatric populations, these issues are of greater concern and are compounded by administration difficulties.  New research focused on reformulation of current therapies to reduce dose-limiting side effects, modifying drug release profiles, and target drug delivery has begun to improve inhaled therapeutics.  \n\nImproving Bioavailability of Poorly Water Soluble Drugs – It is commonly cited that nearly 40% of new compounds identified for therapeutic use exhibit poor aqueous solubility. Many techniques have been used to improve water solubility including particle size reduction, solid dispersion processes, molecular complexation, and self emulsifying systems.  Of particular interest is the stabilization of amorphous drug in a suitable pharmaceutical carrier to improve drug solubility and, ultimately, bioavailability.\n\nEfficacy Studies in Preclinical Models of Airway Disease – Prior to conducting clinical trials for a new inhaled therapy, the drug product must be proven efficacious in one or more animal models. New treatments for airway disease are typically evaluated in a sensitized rodent model that will exhibit pulmonary inflammation and constriction similar to that encountered in asthma and COPD.  A better understanding of the effects of novel formulations, methods of dose administration, sensitization, and response quantification are needed in these models.\n\nPharmacotherapy to Prolong Allograft Survival in Transplant Recipients – Following organ transplant, patients are prescribed a multi-drug regimen consisting of immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and antimetabolites. These transplant therapies are often complicated by opportunistic infection and reduction in patient quality of life due to untoward side effects. Advanced drug formulation and delivery to localize therapy and reduce side effects shows potential to improve outcomes of lung transplant recipients.','http://www.utexas.edu/pharmacy/divisions/pharmaceutics/faculty/watts.html',1,'2012-05-29 09:53:35',NULL),

In particular, my interest lies in the integrative roles of respiratory gas exchange, acid-base balance and osmoregulation, and how these systems are adapted to allow fish to thrive in a diverse array of environments.\n\nOne particular focus of my research involves understanding the evolution and mechanisms of respiratory gas exchange in water breathing animals. The successful uptake of oxygen and excretion of carbon dioxide are integral to all vertebrates, and in most modern teleost fish these processes are tightly linked via red blood cell proteins. However, the levels of the relevant components of red blood cells seem to vary widely among teleosts, and in more ancestral water breathers, such as sharks and hagfish, the red blood cell can be completely bypassed for carbon dioxide excretion. I am interested in deciphering the relative importance of various red blood cell proteins for gas exchange, as well as the evolutionary pressures responsible for driving carbon dioxide transport from the plasma into the red blood cells.\n\nA second major focus of my research is looking at the potential for physiological systems to change in response to varying environments, both of natural and anthropogenic origin. Of particular interest are responses of fish to salinity changes related to evaporative water loss or freshwater inflow in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the impacts of ocean acidification. This is of particular interest today due to the potentially damaging effects of global climate change and ocean acidification on fish populations.\n\nA final area of research involves assessing the impacts of environmental toxins on fish survival, physiology and performance. Most recently I have been involved in examining the toxic effects of polyaromatic hydrocarbons on fish species in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nCurrent species of interest include red drum, summer flounder, spiny dogfish shark, toadfish and the Pacific hagfish.','https://utmsi.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/9-marine-science/323-esbaugh-andrew-j?Itemid=550',1,'2012-11-28 13:28:26','2014-11-20 14:40:21'),

I am looking for an undergraduate to help me with my dissertation project.  The opening is available immediately.  \n\nI am working on a project that will test the ability of the brain’s immune system to regulate alcohol consumption. This knowledge will help us develop insights into the transition from healthy to unhealthy drinking behavior and develop new treatment options for alcoholics.\n\nThe undergraduate will help with various aspects of this project, including training rats to drink alcohol (it\'s fun!).  It will be an ideal project for a student looking to apply to graduate or medical school, and if possible I\'d like to make that a requirement.  They must also be able to commit 10 hours a week for a minimum of 2 semesters, however 3 semesters is ideal.  The first two semesters would be either coursework or work-study.

My research\nThe Afro-Hispanic Languages of the Americas (AHLAs), the languages that developed in Latin America from the contact of African languages and Spanish in colonial times, are rich in structures that would be considered ungrammatical in standard Spanish and that may be used as a powerful testing ground for formal syntactic hypotheses (Kayne 1996; Sessarego 2014). The historical origins of these varieties are extremely intriguing, since it still has to be explained why we do not find creole languages in certain regions of Spanish America, where the socio-demographic conditions for creole languages to emerge appeared to have been in place in colonial times. Nowadays, in contrast, we can find such contact varieties in similar former colonies, which were ruled by the British, the French or the Dutch (McWhorter 2000; Lipski 2005; Schwegler 2010). Despite the fascinating implications of this phenomenon, our knowledge of the AHLAs remains extremely limited, both linguistically and historically. \nThis project will implement a unique combination of sociolinguistic techniques for data collection along with generative models of data analysis, to obtain more fine-grained, empirically testable generalizations on the grammatical nature of the AHLAs. It also draws on a strong interdisciplinary cooperation, capable of combining linguistic, socio-historical, legal and anthropological insights to cast light on the origin of these contact varieties. \n\n2. Nature of the student\'s involvement in the research project\nThe interns will conduct research on a variety of linguistic and socio-historical aspects of the AHLAs. Research will not be limited to coding/transcribing data. Students will carry out projects in which they have an interest. They will meet periodically with me to discuss their findings and will collaborate with other students working on similar topics. The goal is to obtain a publishable paper by the end of the internship. I have a number of identified AHLA topics that would be appropriate for undergraduate research projects of this kind.\n\n3. The nature of the mentoring the student will receive\nThis internship will provide the participant with the opportunity to work on a project related to the AHLAs. Key components of this project include research instruction, academic counseling and mentoring, participation in specialized linguistic conferences, and first-hand experience with outreach service to the local community.\nStudents will work closely with me on a research project. After having selected a specific topic in line with the aim of this research proposal and with the interests of the intern, we will set the goals for the semester. I will meet periodically with the student to answer potential questions, discuss the findings, and exchange ideas on how to proceed towards the established goals.\nStudents will also be encouraged to submit an abstract to present their research to the Texas Linguistics Society Conference (TLSC) and to the Symposium about Language and Society - Austin (SALSA), two student-organized conferences that take place in Austin every year.\nMoreover, the interns will be integrated into a collaboration I have developed with College Forward (CoFo), a non-profit organization based in Austin, Texas, which provides college access and college persistence services to motivated, economically disadvantaged students, in order to facilitate their transition to college and make the process exciting and rewarding.

Our modeling focus is the detailed incorporation of this data to provide a high level of physical and physiological realism and validation, working at the continuum-cellular, fibrous tissue, and whole organ levels. We ultimately seek to provide cardiovascular scientists and clinicians with advanced simulations for the rational development of treatments for structural heart and heart valve diseases. Such simulations can ultimately lead to reduction in development time, lowering of morbidity and mortality, reduced re-operative rates, and lessened post-operative recovery time. Moreover, the development and use of these tools in the context of patient-specific models will ultimately also allow clinicians to craft cardiovascular therapies that are optimized for the cardiovascular system of individuals, with a resulting increase in success and decrease in risk adverse side effects.','http://ccs.ices.utexas.edu/index.html',1,'2016-04-08 11:10:57',NULL),

Animals can also use leverage to obtain resources.  My recent research has suggested that female power in lemurs may include leverage.  This interdisciplinary project uses economic and political theory to explore social relationships in lemurs. The objective of this research is to examine some of the factors relating to power that can lead to variation in social relationships in wild Verreaux\'s sifaka.  Who wins conflicts?  Does it vary by context?  Because females are only larger than males during the rainy season, does female power change during the dry season?  Do females have leverage during the mating season?  How do the power dynamics change when females have infants?  Research on grooming reciprocity in this population of sifaka suggests that individuals may be exchanging services.  How does the exchange of services influence power dynamics?\r\n\r\nBehavioral and morphological data have been collected on a wild population of Verreaux\'s sifaka.  Most of the data have been entered into a relational database.  However, some additional data need to be pulled from the original datasheets.

Surprisingly, captive studies often find that chimpanzees fail to cooperate.  In humans, failure to cooperate can arise from the collective action problem (CAP), also known as “the tragedy of the commons”.  The CAP occurs when individuals of a group can receive a collective benefit regardless of whether they participate in the collective activity that gives rise to the benefit.  When too many individuals “free-ride,” the level of cooperation needed to obtain the benefit may not be met and the benefit becomes unavailable to all group members.  Studies of cooperation in humans have found various mechanisms for overcoming free-riding, including punishment and private incentives.  Because wild chimpanzees exhibit cooperative behaviors in spite of the possibilities for free-riding, they probably have evolved mechanisms to overcome the CAP.  This project is an investigation of the CAP in captive chimpanzees and the mechanisms they use to overcome the CAP.  Cooperation is experimentally studied in 7 social groups of chimpanzees at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Research Center in Bastrop, Texas.  This experiment is designed to determine (1) whether the chimpanzees can overcome the CAP, and (2) the mechanisms they use.  This study of the CAP in chimpanzees will provide insights into the evolution of cooperation and negotiation in humans. \r\n\r\nResearch assistants will help collect behavioral data from videos collected during the behavioral experiments.

The inhibitory signal is mediated through the neurotransmitter GABA, as measured by short intracortical inhibition (SICI).

A decrease in SICI, for example during non REM sleep, or an increase in BDNF, for example in the morning or by photic stimulation, can precipitate a seizure. Restoring normal thalamic activity through modulation of the cerebellum by low frequency rTMS will reset the balance and restore normal cortical excitability.

However, effective use of this data requires accurate information retrieval technology designed for and evaluated on spontaneous speech data. Unfortunately, traditional practice for benchmarking search engine accuracy cannot scale to “big data”, especialy for conversational speech. This restricts our ability to even measure the effectiveness of existing search engines, much less further advance them. \n\nEvaluating search with spontaneous speech archives is particularly challenging vs. more traditional text collections. Unlike text, speech must first be transcribed, and while prepared speech (e.g. broadcast news) transcripts are very readable, spontaneous speech transcripts are often very difficult to read, even with perfect transcription, due to \"disfluency\" (self-corrections, trailing off, interruptions, etc.) and lack of commas and sentence boundaries. Human editing to correct this would require even greater manual effort. As a result, few spontaneous speech IR test collections exist today.\n\nWe are investigating use of nascent crowdsourcing (crowd computing) techniques in concert with \"rich transcription\" technology. While crowdsourcing offers tremendous potential for time and cost savings, how to achieve these savings without compromising quality remains an open research problem.

	(109,4934,2228,'Incorporating spatial autocorrelation in species distribution models',NULL,'The use of species distribution models (SDM) to map and monitor animal and plant distributions has become increasingly important in the context of awareness of environmental change and its ecological consequences. Although increasingly sophisticated statistical methods are being used in SDM, the vast majority has been developed without considering spatial autocorrelation in the data. When spatial autocorrelation is ignored and nonspatial statistical methods are used, coefficient estimates are less precise and overall the models can be poorly specified. Explicitly spatial statistical methods not only can improve upon these model calibration issues, but they can also incorporate information on spatial processes such as competition, dispersal and disturbance. Although there has been a recent increase in SDM studies that address explicitly spatial statistical methods, results have been incongruous and difficult to synthesize. The location- , data-, or scale-specific nature of these studies has impeded efforts to disentangle the effects of spatial structure in the data, sampling strategy, the scale of the study, and statistical methods used. This project addresses each of these issues specifically with the general research question: how does spatial autocorrelation affect species distribution models? This research focuses on using multi-resolution simulated distribution maps and novel assessment measures in order to analyze how differences in each of the four issues- spatial structure, sampling strategy, scale, and statistical methods- impact SDM both separately and in concert. \n\nThe main outcome of this project will be a framework that can be used to guide all aspects of model conceptualization and development (sampling strategy, statistical method(s) used, appropriate spatial scale) when using binary data with spatial autocorrelation. This research will make an important contribution to a greater understanding of how spatial autocorrelation affects inductive models used with binary response data. Beyond predicting species distributions, these models have become an important and widely used decision-making tool for a variety of biogeographical applications, such as studying the effects of climate change, identifying potential protected areas, determining locations potentially susceptible to invasion, and mapping vector-borne disease spread and risk. Outside of biogeography, similar binary response models are used in medical/health applications (e.g., diagnostic tests) and economic and social sciences (e.g. labor market status, credit scoring, voting behavior).  \n','','','','','Jennifer Miller','jennifer.miller@austin.utexas.edu','','2013-01-09 10:42:33','2013-01-09 10:46:59'),
	(110,4934,2228,'Analyzing dynamic interactions from animal movement data',NULL,'New developments in GPS and related satellite tracking technologies have facilitated the collection of highly accurate data on moving objects, far surpassing the ability to analyze them. Within geographic information science (GIScience), ‘movement pattern analysis’ (MPA) has developed as a subfield that addresses concepts and theories used to explore the spatio-temporal structure in data in order to perform meaningful analysis. Research in MPA extends previous work on time-geography that focused primarily on representation and semantics, therefore the methodological and analytical framework associated with MPA is new and still evolving. Most MPA applications address the movement of automobiles (e.g., traffic, fleet management), people (e.g., pedestrians, queues), or animals. Although there are obvious and fundamental differences among these three application types, there are also many important commonalities associated with the analysis of any movement data irrespective of the type of object.\n\nInteractions, for which the basic unit of observation is a pair of locations for two individuals, can be considered a second order property of movement but their social and psychological explanations and implications are far less generalizable. Within MPA, human interactions have been studied far more extensively than any other type, and they are often based on detailed information such as ‘travel diaries’ from which activity spaces can be calculated and intersections of multiple activity spaces can be used to derive social interaction metrics (Farber et al. 2012). The nature of interactions between individuals of an animal population is a fundamental aspect of a species’ behavioral ecology and information on the frequency and duration of these interactions is vital to understanding mating and territorial behavior, resource use, and infectious disease epidemiology. However, the number of times an individual animal comes into contact with another is an extremely difficult parameter to estimate, and previous studies have focused on highly observable species living within protected areas or urban areas (ex. foxes in Bristol, UK: White & Harris 1994). For relatively rare or secretive species, or those occupying less-accessible habitats, complete and accurate information regarding rates of contact is generally scarce.\n\nPreliminary research has shown that current interaction metrics produce quite variable results and do not facilitate meaningful interpretations of interaction rates in general (Miller 2012). The goal of this research is to develop a novel framework that can be used to analyze and interpret dynamic interactions between individuals. The case study used to explore these methods comprises GPS collar data from sixteen brown hyena individuals in Northern Botswana and interactions will be studied for eight intra-clan pairs (dyads) and eight inter-clan pairs of different composition (female-female, female-male). Five different techniques that have been used to quantify dynamic interactions based on GPS data of pairs of individuals will be used here, and they will be compared in the context of spatially explicit simulated data intended to represent biologically realistic null models for individual movement, and subsequently paired interactions. In addition, a new method will be introduced that quantifies change in movement trajectories for each individual in a dyad as a more informative indication of either positive or negative interaction (attraction or avoidance, respectively). \n\n','','','','','jennifer miller','jennifer.miller@austin.utexas.edu','','2013-01-09 10:46:14',NULL),

The project typically has 4-5 graduate students to interact with, and a shared lab space with some seating available.\n\nCrowdsourcing involves outsourcing of tasks to a large group of people instead of assigning such tasks to an in-house employee or contractor. While we have successfully automated many routine tasks, human competency still exceeds automated algorithms for many other, more complex processing tasks, such as analyzing text or imagery. Today’s Internet-based access to 24/7 online human crowds has led to the advent of crowdsourcing and a renaissance of research in using human computers once more. These new opportunities have brought a disruptive shift to research and practice for how we build intelligent systems today. On one hand, labeled data for training and evaluation can be collected faster, cheaper, and easier than ever before. While traditional scarcity of labeled data has helped to drive research on unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, strategic use of crowdsourcing now allows us to collect the labels needed on demand and at scale. With access to a human crowd “on-call” whenever the system has a question, there is tremendous potential for intelligent systems to enjoy constant, lifetime learning. \n\nIn addition to collecting labeled data, human computation is also being increasingly integrated into intelligent systems themselves, operating in concert with AI. While AI accuracies will certainly continue to improve, use of human computation in concert with automation lets us achieve greater capabilities today using hybrid systems.

Although the relevance of natural resource depletion caused by indigenous populations is still debated, the human imprint on the region’s natural resources following European colonization is only contentious with regards to its extent and timing. Once proved economically viable by the Portuguese in Brazil, sugar exportation became an ideal excuse to ascertain human taming of nature throughout the Insular Caribbean. The exploitation of both terrestrial and marine resources that occurred in the first two sugar-producing islands of St. Kitts and Barbados in the 17th century was replicated in much of the Antilles, albeit at different time periods. The eventual collapse of sugar production meant a reversion to forests for as long as economic opportunities entailing other forms of extensive natural resource use, such as tourism, took to emerge.\n\nThis study focuses on the environmental histories of two specific case studies in the Northeastern Caribbean, the island of St. John and Puerto Rico, nowadays both U.S. possessions but formerly Danish and Spanish colonies, respectively. Special emphasis is given to the potential incompatibility of expected cause and effect relations between documented land use patterns and its effects on sediment yields and downstream coral reef ecosystems. In St. John, even though the island’s forest cover diminished to less than half of its landmass during most of the second half of the 18th century, unequivocal signs of increased coral reef stress by increased sediment yields are absent in the sedimentary record until the mid-20th century when a significant portion of the island’s landmass became a national park. In northeastern Puerto Rico, coral reef degradation occurred between the late 1970s and 1980s while sediment yields presumably declined as the adjoining watersheds were undergoing major reforestation.

	(251,25605,3807,'Cognitive behavior therapy/hypnotherapy (CBT/HT) program in the treatment of pediatric functional gastrointestinal disease: A randomized controlled trial comparing in-person versus telehealth. ','2016-08-10 00:00:00','Functional Gastrointestinal Diseases (FGID) are a family disorders that are characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms in the absence of readily identifiable organic pathology. Examples of FGID include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, abdominal migraine, functional abdominal pain, and functional abdominal pain syndrome. These disorders are classically thought to stem from dysfunction of the enteric nervous system. However, there is a growing recognition that multiple factors play a role in the genesis of FGIDs. This idea is encapsulated by the “biopsychosocial” model of disease, and is supported by a body of literature which has identified higher rates of FGID in patients with anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia, and other pychosocial dysfunction. \n\nRecurrent Abdominal Pain (RAP) and IBS are major causes of pediatric morbidity. Over a third of children and adolescents report recurrent abdominal pain, and the overall prevalence of non-organic abdominal pain has been noted to be over 75% (Hyams, Treem, Justinich, Davis, Shoup, & Burke, 1995; Schwille, Giel, Ellert, Zipfel, & Enck, 2009). A large subset of these children report symptoms that are consistent with irritable bowel syndrome. Management of these children is complex and includes medical, dietary, and behavioral interventions. Medical therapy often revolves around the use of antispasmodics, probiotics, and antidepressants. The data supporting their use, however, has been mixed. \n\nOver the last twenty years behavioral therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and hypnotherapy (HT) have come to light as major treatment modalities for functional gastrointestinal disease. In a large multicenter randomized controlled trial, Levy et al. (2010) compared 3-session CBT to a control intervention and noted significant improvements in pain and functioning in children. Similar results have been published in multiple smaller trials (Duarte, Penna, Andrade, Cancela, Neto, & Barbosa, 2006; Gros, Antony, McCabe, & Lydiard, 2011; Mahvi-Shirazi, Fathi-Ashtiani, Rasoolzade-Tabatabaei, & Amini, 2012; Robins, Smith, Glutting, & Bishop, 2005; Youssef et al., 2004). Likewise, Vlieger and colleagues (2007) compared hypnotherapy to standard medical therapy in 53 children with irritable bowel syndrome. They found that, while both interventions resulted in improved pain scores, the hypnotherapy group demonstrated lasting clinical improvement at 1 year follow-up. Five year follow-up data has recently been published and revealed that significantly more of the hypnotherapy group remained in remission without any further intervention (Vlieger, Rutten, Govers, Frankenhuis, & Benninga, 2012). A growing body of literature is available validating the use of hypnotherapy in irritable bowel syndrome in adults, and pain syndromes more generally (Calvert, Houghton, Cooper, Morris, & Whorwell, 2002; Rutten, Reitsma, Vlieger, & Benninga, 2012; Lindfors et al., 2012; Whorwell, Prior, & Faragher, 1984). \n\nCBT and HT can be viewed as complementary to one another. CBT involves a very deliberate conscious understanding of one’s disease process and triggers and focuses on successful pain mitigation measures. HT recruits the imagination with utilization of therapeutic imagery to down regulate inappropriate pain responses. Our center has developed a collaborative approach, utilizing both CBT and HT for the treatment of refractory IBS. To our knowledge no work has been done assessing the efficacy of such a collaborative approach using both CBT and HT in children with functional gastrointestinal disease.\n\nFinally, telehealth is a growing field aimed at reducing barriers to effective treatments. Telehealth allows specialty treatments to reach patients who are in need (Sato, Clifford, Silverman, & Davies, 2009). Telehealth is defined as the utilization of technology that allows providers and patients the opportunity to interact with one another from a distance (McGeary, McGeary, & Gatchel, 2012). Even though CBT via videoconferencing is an acceptable alternative to face-to-face CBT, the authors are unaware of any study that has compared the two different modes of treatment in addressing FGIDs in youth (Sato et al., 2009). Further, while previous research suggests that hypnosis can be effectively delivered via telehealth in adults (Appel, Bleiberg, & Noiseux, 2002; Simpson et al., 2002), this has yet to be examined for youth.\n','No specific qualifications.

The terrain in the research site is quite hilly in places, seasonally floods in others, and the climate is often hot, humid, and rainy – this is a rainforest just south of the Equator in which 3 to 4 meters of rain falls a year – thus persistence, maturity, dedication, good humor, and an excellent work ethic are extremely important. Preference will be given to applicants with previous outdoor experience in demanding environments.','','Max Snodderly','max.snodderly@austin.utexas.edu','','2017-04-27 10:47:47','2017-04-27 10:49:04'),
